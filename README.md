# Toolbar Dial

Toolbar Dial is a browser extension that replaces the New Tab page with a colorful grid of bookmarks and folders.

## Features

### It Feels Good to Be in Charge

Like an airplane that offers a pilot many controls at their command, Toolbar Dial offers a myriad of options to fine tune the appearance to your liking. No configuration is required, though, and opinionated defaults have been automatically selected for you.

### Live by the URL, die by the URL?

Not with Toolbar Dial! Web browsers often include a built-in new-tab page with a list of frequently visited sites, but they offer only a single letter representing the website. With Toolbar Dial, you have the option to view a stylized representation of the URL, or choose to use the bookmark's title as the representation in the dial instead. It's your choice!

### Made to Fit

With an option to specify the maximum number of columns, rest assured that the visualized grid perfectly complements the number of bookmarks displayed by Toolbar Dial. Have a ton of bookmarks? No problem! Select the 'Unlimited' option to fill up your devices screen. Choose what fits you best!

### Find a Perfect Background

Toolbar Dial offers a curated collection of complementary background colors and images. Have a favorite photo of your family -- or vehicle? (We're not judging!) Browse your device and select a favorite photo to use as the background image. If you'd rather utilize a solid color background that doesn't distract you from the many choices of websites you have to visit, that's an option as well! Customize the color with the color picker, or enter the HEX code of your favorite color.

### Turn Out the Lights

By default, Toolbar Dial uses your device's theme to style modals, context menus, and the Options page. However, with a simple preference change, the Light theme or Dark theme will override the device theme. Conditional to the theme being used, a dark color or light color is placed behind the title text displayed beneath dials, to help increase contrast with background images. If your device theme automatically changes based on time of day, leave the option to 'Device Theme' to keep Toolbar Dial synchronized.

### Default Folder

Toolbar Dial gets its name from the characteristic of which bookmarks are displayed as dials on the grid. When first ran, bookmarks in the 'Bookmarks Toolbar' folder, for Firefox, or the 'Bookmarks bar' folder for Chrome, are used to populate the grid. The Options page offers a preference to select any folder to be used as the default folder instead. Have a certain folder that you use for work or school? Simply change the preference in Options and immediately find those bookmarks displayed on the grid! It couldn't be simpler!

### Open Bookmarks in New Tab

One of the great features of Toolbar Dial is that if you navigate to a nested bookmark folder and then visit a website, your current location will be remembered by the browser when you later click the back button and return to Toolbar Dial. However, if you'd prefer to always open in a new tab, that option is available as well!

### Humble Beginnings

Originally created as a Firefox addon inspired by Opera's Speed Dial, Toolbar Dial has evolved to become a highly desired new-tab replacement for modern web browsers. Please continue sending notes with suggested enhancements and special requests that would make Toolbar Dial an even more desirable experience in your life. Your feedback drives the future of Toolbar Dial and will make it even better.

### It's All About the Feels

To all who have written emails and left reviews with kind words about how Toolbar Dial has become your preferred new-tab replacement for Firefox, Chrome, and the new Edge browser -- thank you! It's your continued support that makes the many hours spent developing Toolbar Dial worth it.
